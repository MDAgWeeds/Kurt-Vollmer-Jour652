	<h2>Experience</h2>

	<h3>Extension Weed Management Specialist</h3>
	<h4>University of Maryland</h4>
	<h5>June 2019-present</h5>
	<p>I investigate novel and integrated approaches to weed control in cropping systems in order to help farmers develop profitable and sustainable agricultural systems. I present results from field studies in peer-reviewed journals, on social media, on websites, at extension meetings, at professional conferences, and via demonstrations at university research and education centers.I work to contribute expertise to training materials for pesticide recertification and the Certified Crop Advisor program; and conduct annual/semiannual in-service training for extension personnel.</p>

	<h3>Postdoctoral Researcher</h3> 
	<h4>Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Delaware</h4>
	<h5>September 2015-September 2019</h5>
	<p>I investigated novel approaches to weed control by assisting with and coordinating field research trials in grain and vegetable cropping systems. I presented these results at extension meetings, field days, professional conferences, and through peer-reviewed journal publications, extension 	newsletters, and other media.</p> 

	<h3>Research Assistant</h3>
	<h4>Virginia Tech Eastern Shore Agricultural Research and Extension Center</h4>
